## Traffic Load Balancing

Design a multipath network where there are multiple paths from
one switch to another. Implement an algorithm to load balance the
traffic based on link parameters or load on a switch. Measure the
utilization and performance of the network. For load‐balancing
algorithms it may be interesting (but not compulsory) to read § 14.
